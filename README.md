### MacroBot

- Simple IDE for creating PC task bots
- Full-featured: Text-based script editing, Block-based script editing, Detection of images on the screen, Mouse and keyboard control, variable manager, starting up of other apps...
- Programming language is simple and of my own making based on [Ruslan&apos;s blog](http://localhost/). Source code for the language is [here](https://github.com/Moxidus/MacroBotV0.1Language)
- This project was created as a final exam project for highschool, so it is unlikely that it will be updated.
